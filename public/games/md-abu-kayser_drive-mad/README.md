DriveMad is a lightweight, arcade‑style HTML5 racing game optimized for short, high‑energy browser play sessions. It is implemented as a static single‑page web app (Canvas/WebGL) with responsive controls and multi‑input support (keyboard, gamepad, touch).

This README is designed to be visitor‑facing and client‑ready: it documents how to play, how to run the project locally, development guidance, project layout, performance notes, and recommended next steps to make the repository impressive to potential clients and employers.

## Overview

DriveMad focuses on immediate, arcade‑style gameplay: tight steering, fast sessions, and replayable challenges. The repo currently contains a static build (single page entry) and core assets in `css/` and `js/`. There is no bundler or package manifest detected in the repository root - development instructions below include both manual and optional Node-based workflows.

## Demo & Media

- Host the repository (or the `dist/` folder if you create one) on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). For the cleanest demo experience, upload an animated gameplay GIF (5–10s) and screenshots into an `assets/` or `docs/` folder and link them here.
- Recommended banner & preview assets:
  - `assets/readme-banner.png` (1280×360) - optional hero image
  - `assets/demo.gif` (5–10s) - short gameplay loop

## Key Features

- Tight, arcade‑style driving physics
- Multiple tracks and vehicles (configurable in code)
- Input support: Keyboard, Gamepad, Touch
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- Small, dependency‑free distribution (pure HTML/CSS/JS by default)

## How to Play (Controls)

Default keyboard controls (configurable in code):

- Steer: Arrow keys / A D
- Accelerate: W / Up
- Brake / Reverse: S / Down
- Boost / Nitro: Shift / Space
- Horn / Interact: H or E
- Pause / Menu: Esc

Gamepad: standard controllers map axes to steering and triggers to throttle/brake. Touch: use on‑screen virtual controls when available.

## Quick Local Run (PowerShell)

To avoid CORS and media autoplay restrictions use a local HTTP server rather than opening `index.html` directly.

PowerShell - Python's simple HTTP server (Windows):

```powershell
# From repository root, serve port 8000 and open browser
python -m http.server 8000; Start-Process "http://localhost:8000"
```

Node (if you prefer `http-server`):

```powershell
npx http-server -c-1 . -p 8000; Start-Process "http://localhost:8000"
```

Notes:

- If you later add a `dist/` folder (build output), serve `dist/` instead of the repository root.
- Some browsers block autoplay for audio; click/tap once to unlock sound.

## Development & Build (recommended)

Currently there is no `package.json` detected in the repo. For modern development, I recommend adding a minimal Node toolchain. Example `package.json` scripts below can be adapted for your preferred bundler.

Suggested quick setup (optional):

```powershell
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev vite
```

Add these example scripts to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
	"dev": "vite",
	"build": "vite build --outDir dist",
	"preview": "vite preview --port 5000"
}
```

Why use a bundler?

- Faster dev server with HMR (hot module replacement)
- Easy asset pipeline and cache busting
- Production optimizations (minification, tree‑shaking)

If you prefer to keep the project dependency‑free, continue editing `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/*.js` directly and use the simple local server instructions above to preview changes.

## Project Structure (current)

```
index.html
LICENSE
README.md
css/
	styles.css
js/
	script.js
	scripts.js
```

- `index.html`: Single page entry. Inspect this file to find boot/asset paths.
- `css/styles.css`: Layout and styles.
- `js/script.js`, `js/scripts.js`: Game logic and initialization. Consider splitting larger modules and moving to `src/` if you add a bundler.

## Performance Tips

- Bundle and minify JS for production (Vite, Webpack, or Rollup).
- Combine small images into sprite atlases.
- Compress audio and use short audio sprites for SFX.
- Defer or lazy‑load large assets (music, future levels) after the main menu.
- Aim for stable 60 FPS: profile using browser devtools and optimize the game loop throttle.

## Contributing & Code Quality

If you plan to open this project to outside contributors, add these repo files:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - contribution workflow and PR template
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - expected community behavior
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` / `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - templates for quick triage

**Simple contributor workflow (recommended):**

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch
2. Run the project locally and reproduce the issue or feature
3. Open a PR with a clear description, screenshots, and testing steps

Recommended linters / tools:

- ESLint for JS code quality
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Git hooks (Husky) to run linters before commits

### Roadmap & Changelog

**Short‑term enhancements:**

- Add a polished demo GIF and README banner
- Introduce a bundler (`vite`) and `dist/` build output
- Create an options/settings screen (control remapping, audio levels)

**Medium‑term enhancements:**

- Persistent progression (localStorage or server profiles)
- Level editor and community track sharing
- Accessibility improvements and full gamepad remapping

Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes if you publish versions.

### Next Steps / Planned Improvements

- Add gameplay demo assets (`assets/readme-banner.png`, `assets/demo.gif`) for improved preview
- Introduce a minimal build setup using Vite and generate a production `dist/` folder
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for open collaboration
- Add additional badges (build status, demo link) to the README header
