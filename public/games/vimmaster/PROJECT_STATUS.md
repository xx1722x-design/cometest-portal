| **Current version** | v3.0.0 — Community Alpha (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)) |
| **Current phase** | ✅ Phase 0 (bugs) · ✅ tooling/tests (unit + contract + golden + regression) · ✅ **content extraction** (35 JSON lessons in `/content/lessons`) → ▶️ Community Alpha hardening ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)) |
| **Current sprint** | PR24: every lesson provably solvable — `solution` in all 35 lessons, Golden Suite auto-verifies each (35/35), L007 promoted to ERROR |
| **Current focus** | **Codebase hygiene complete**: 0 lint errors/warnings with strict rules in CI, 0 console noise, practice-mode regression fixed. Next: **Community Alpha release checklist** (QUALITY.md) |
| **Next milestone** | Community Alpha announcement once the release checklist in QUALITY.md is green |
| **Release target** | v1.0 after the pure-core engine rewrite + platform pages — no date commitment; quality gates over deadlines |
