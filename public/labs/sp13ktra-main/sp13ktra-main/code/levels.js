// Owns: the eight campaign circuits as data, one per racer (ten until 2026-09-13: ALBEDO folded into UMBRA, then the angular ULTRAVIOLET went and the blue figure eight took its name). circuitTable is the spectrum ladder
// (palette, lanes, ground drop, swell, scenery theme, density, sky kit),
// circuitCorners the corner polygons the skeleton builds each loop from. LevelInfo turns one table row
// into the colours and ladder values the rest of the game reads.
//
// Entry point: initLevelInfos() (game.js, at startup) fills levelInfoList, and
// game.js picks levelInfo = levelInfoList[currentCircuit] before buildTrack.
// trackGen.js reads circuitCorners; track.js reads the palette; hud.js reads the
// names for the menu list and the results.
// Load order: skeleton.js must come first because the corner data reads the
// SK_* flags at load.

// The spectrum ladder, one row per circuit:
//   [name, hue, sat, drop, bump, theme, density, sky, scenery]
// drop: how far the lowest road sits above the ground plane (every circuit has one: the
// `ground` column was 1 on all nine and went on 2026-09-13); bump: periodic
// swell amplitude added to the keyframed heights (keep it small on crossing circuits);
// theme picks the circuit's scenery shape (buildScenery in track.js: 0 spike, 1 city block,
// 2 crystal, 3 ziggurat, 4 floating slab, 5 spire, 6 leaning shard, 7 monolith); a quarter
// of the pieces speak the (theme+3)%8 language in the same palette. density scales
// mid-field groups.
// sky bits (the track.js kit): 1 big low sun (else small and high), 2 stars, 4 clouds, 8 eclipse,
// 16 a giant sun (SODIUM), 32 a two-colour sun, the accent on its halo and outer disc (FILAMENT).
// scenery bits (buildScenery): 2 colossal far giants (twice the size), 4 sparse roadside
// cues (every 24 samples), 8 a second recharge strip on the left halfway round (trackGen.js).
// (1 was no infield at all; nobody set it, and it went on 2026-09-13.)
// 32 a canyon: a plinth of .55-1.25 of the drop under every piece (mostly from the height envelope),
// so the towers climb from the deep ground to about road level (AURORA); 64 lifts that range by .4
// to .95-1.65, so more of them peak above the road (UMBRA);
// 128 a dense infield, the spacing between pieces halved (CHERENKOV).
// bank, rival skill and pad spacing climb the ladder by formula (LevelInfo), and the lane count
// and the finale's rainbow come from the index too (their columns went on 2026-09-13).
